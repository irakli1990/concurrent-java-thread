/**
 * Write a program in which a pair of threads implemented by classes Alice and Bob are interacting with each other.
 * <p>
 * Bob has a method setInput(int x) which sets a value of his internal variable (field) named input.
 * In his run() method Bob executes an infinite loop in which he repeatedly checks the state of his interruption flag. Upon interruption he reads value of his input field and:
 * prints a goodbye message and stops if the value is 0;
 * prints a doubled value of input and continues.
 *
 * @see exercise.third.alice.Alice
 * Hint. Bob should check his interruption flag using interrupted() method instead of isInterrupted() as the former also clears the flag.
 * <p>
 * Please, check how the programâ€™s output changes if Alice does not wait after sending a number to Bob.
