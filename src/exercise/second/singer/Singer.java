 * Singer is not drunk yet
 * Letâ€™s assume that the threads from Exercise 1 are connected in a list, so that a thread with N=i directly precedes the thread with N=i+1.
 * This can be achieved with adding Singer next private field to Singer class which can be set with an additional public void setNext(Singer next) { this.next = next; } method.
 * Try to modify the run() method of the threads so that the lyrics of the song are printed in order, i.e. starting at 99 down to 0.
 *
 * The structure of the main() method in this case should resemble the following
